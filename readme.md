# 🛒 FUTURE_FS_02 – E-Commerce Platform (Microservices Based)

This project is part of my **Future Interns – Full Stack Web Development Internship (Task 2)**.  
It is a **mini E-Commerce platform** built using the **MERN stack** with a **microservices architecture** and an **API Gateway**.  
The project demonstrates **end-to-end full-stack skills**, covering frontend, backend, authentication, order management, and deployment.
